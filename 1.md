# Project 1: 🖥️ Ai Workflow App - Screenshot Annotation and Search

---

## 🚀 Overview

In this project, we build a simple app that processes screenshots from a local folder, annotates them using an AI model, and organizes the data for easy search and retrieval. This method helps manage and search through large collections of screenshots.

## 📋 **Project Overview**

### **AI Screenshot Annotation**

This project is based on the idea of improving screenshot management. Over time, your screenshots folder can get overwhelming, and finding specific images becomes a challenge. By using the **Lava 1.6** AI model, we can automatically annotate each screenshot with a description, making it easier to search for and organize your images.

#### **Main Components**:
- **Screenshots Folder**: A folder containing images (e.g., PNG, JPEG) that need to be processed.
- **AI Model**: Lava 1.6 model is used to annotate the images. It's best to use models with higher parameter counts (13B, 34B) for better accuracy.
- **CSV File**: All annotated data is stored in a CSV for future reference or use in a database.

## 🧑‍💻 **Technical Process**

### **Folder Management**
- We first scan the folder where screenshots are saved. Over time, this folder can become quite large, and manually browsing through it is inefficient.
- We retrieve the list of files and sort them for processing.

### **AI Image Annotation**
- Images are loaded, converted to byte format, and passed to Lava 1.6 for annotation.
- A custom **prompt** is used to guide the AI in describing the image, with specific focus on text within the image for better search results.

### **Model Selection**
- The **7B, 13B, and 34B** models are available, with the 13B model providing a good balance between speed and accuracy. The 34B model is the most accurate but requires more system resources.
  
### **CSV File Handling**
- If a **CSV file** exists, it’s loaded and checked for already processed images.
- If an image hasn’t been processed, it is annotated and added to the CSV with the corresponding description.
